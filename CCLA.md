## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** shall mean the legal entity on behalf of which the Contribution is submitted.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is clearly marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**"Work"** shall mean the work of authorship, which is made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Work means the work of authorship to which the Contribution was submitted.

**"Employee"** shall mean any employee, contractor, or agent of Your company who is authorized to submit Contributions on Your behalf.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
