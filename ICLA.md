## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is clearly marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**"Work"** shall mean the work of authorship, which is made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Work means the work of authorship to which the Contribution was submitted.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 5. Submission on Behalf of Others

If You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Us separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
